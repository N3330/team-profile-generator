Email address directs to default email application and github usernames links to that user's profile page. When the application is started I am am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team. When engineer is selected I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
